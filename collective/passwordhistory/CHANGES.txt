collective.passwordhistory changes
==================================

0.2 svn/dev
-----------

- Major architectural changes. We now (ab)use the IUserAdderPlugin and
  IUserManagement plugin methods to add/update/remove passwords from the
  used password storage, rather than using ICredentialsUpdatePlugin.
  This also means we don't need to patch PlonePAS to fire the
  PrincipalDeleted event, and we don't need a subscriber for that event
  any more.

- Check to see if Plone auto-generates user's initial passwords. If this is
  the case, don't store the auto-generated password.

- Improved tests. Added functional tests.
